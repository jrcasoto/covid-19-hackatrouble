# COVID-19 HackaTrouble Event

### About HackaTrouble
HackaTrouble's objective  is to find innovative solutions, which can be implemented in the short term (48 hours), to meet the various challenges of society, arising from restrictions and difficulties with the dissemination of the Covid-19 coronavirus in Brazil.

### Challenges

The challenges are listed in the thematic axes, to develop innovative software and that it is possible to be implemented in 4 (four) weeks after the end of HackaTrouble and delivered to society free of charge for a period of 6 (six) months. HackaTrouble is limited to 100 (one hundred) teams entered, in validated order of entry. Depending on an eventual withdrawal and/or refusal to register, the remaining teams will be invited to participate.

Each team must choose in the Immersion Stage (described in the Rules) the Challenge they want to compete.

### Use-case
Develop a dashboard with a linear regression model in order to check which counties have available hospital beds (introducing people transfers for nearest available hospitals) and when/if a specific county won't have available hospital beds in Brazilian territory.

### Acknowledgments
This work was only possible with support from my colleagues William Bueno and Henrique Branco.
